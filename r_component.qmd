## Questions:

1.  Being a data scientist is about being able to understand and manipulate data while also being able to effectively communicate the story it's telling
2.  Data scientists and statisticians are similar ...

## R Code:

This code saves an object as 'y' that reports the density of the petal.width column on the iris data set:

```{r}
y <- density(iris$Petal.Width)
y
```

The following code reports the class, type and structure of y:

```{r}
class(y)
typeof(y)
str(y)
```

Here we have hidden the code that produces the following plot:

```{r}
#| echo: false
 plot(y)
```
